to test:

generate a level in `leveleditor`
test it

open console

enter command `debugai` and look at the structure/body/whatever count on top left
enter command `convertleveltostructures ff_x_wall` (or whatever your desired wall structure name is)
wait until it stops increasing, then do `subeditor` to view the walls created
